# JourneysMiddle
 The Journey's Middle was created with the intention of making it easy for people to share ideas in a non-commercial way. While other social media sites are larger and more popular, they also tend to be commercial enterprises. The put up paywalls, plaster advertisements everywhere, and experiment with the effects of different algorithms on the mental states of their users.

 We're different.

 The Journey's Middle isn't about making money. It's not about gathering (and selling) the information of its users. It's not about a political ideology. It's about people. People on a journey of discovery. We start small, with so little knowledge, so little experience. We grow and learn. And many of us never want to stop learning.

 Life has no destination. Life doesn't follow a planned route. Life a journey. And from the day we're born until the day we die, we are in the middle of that journey.

 Welcome to The Journey's Middle. Happy Journeys.
